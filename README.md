Test Project 

Name Akif 

The first challenge was that to implement new feaure Mqtt because i had old version of qt installed.
I enjoyed to learn Mqtt concept and to implement it.
Yes, for sure i can improve it if i have some more time and to install latest version of qt, which i am not have right now.
It took arround 2 to 3 hours to undrstand and complete it.
It was a good task for me, atleat i got chance to learn Mqtt concept, whichs seems better than socket.

Note: As if now this is not a compiled code reason being i dont have qt latest version installed on my personal laptop.
